# Advent of Code (AOC) 2022

This repo contains my advent of code submissions for 2022.
This year my goals are:
- [ ] Optimize for readability (no dense 1-liners)
- [ ] Crack Top 10000 if I start when it opens (at midnight)
- [ ] Stream at least a few of them
- [ ] ~~Do all 25~~ Get further than [last year](https://github.com/LamarrD/advent-of-code-2021) :)
